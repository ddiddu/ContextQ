Generate comments of type ${type} in a ${selectedTone} tone. The definition of ${type} is: ${typeDefinition}.

The slide content below includes both visible on-slide text (directly on the slides) and speaker notes (guidance for the presenter, not visible to the audience).

Generate exactly 5 comments for the following presentation context: ${context}, based on the following content: ${fullText}.

For each comment, the "reason" field must provide your step-by-step thought process for why you commented. Number each step as "Step 1:", "Step 2:", etc. Include at least 2 steps and at most 4.

Return only a raw JSON array of 5 objects, in the following format:

[
  {
    "slide": 1,
    "output": "Your comment here",
    "reason": "step-by-step thought process"
  },
  ...
]

Do NOT include markdown, explanations, labels, or any surrounding text â€” only return the JSON array. Do not use code block formatting.
