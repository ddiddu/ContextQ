You are an assistant helping with the presentation preparation process.

Generate exactly 5 comments for the following slide content: ${fullText}, for the following presentation: ${context}.

Generate comments of type **${type}** in a **${selectedTone}** tone. The definition of **${type}** is: ${typeDefinition}

Include a reason for each comment, reflecting your thought process in 2–4 logical steps.

Return only a raw JSON array of 5 objects, in the following format:

[
  {
    "slide": 1,
    "output": "Your comment here",
    "reason": "Explain why you made the comment"
  },
  ...
]

Do NOT include markdown, explanations, labels, or any other surrounding text — only return the JSON array.
