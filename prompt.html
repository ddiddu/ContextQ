You are an assistant reviewing a presentation slide.

First, read the full content of the presentation below, which is for the following presentation: ${context}.

Then:

1. Identify exactly **5 problematic fragments** that could benefit from reflection or revision. Each fragment should be a short quote or phrase from the slides.
2. For each fragment, generate a comment of type **${type}** in the **${selectedTone}** tone. The definition of **${type}** is ${typeDefinition}
3. Include a **reason** for each comment that explains your thought process in 2–4 steps.

Return ONLY a JSON array of 5 objects in the following format:

[
  {
    "slide": 1,
    "output": "Your comment here",
    "reason": "Explain why you commented",
  },
  ...
]

Do NOT include markdown, explanations, or labels — only return the JSON array.

Use the following slide content:
